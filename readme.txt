== Description ==

### Error Log Viewer By WP Guru - Best Error Log Viewer Plugin for WordPress ###

A Lightweight Plugin to Handle Error Logs easily and efficiently.

Error Log Viewer By WP Guru is a great Free WordPress plugin if you are looking to manage Error log entries and kill errors on time. Error logs help you monitor your site and provide visibility into important changes that occur on your website. PHP error logs, including WordPress logs, can help you to spot problems and identify the offending plugin, theme, or custom code.

Logging errors is considered one of the top “best practices” in software development; it becomes more important as your website grows and scales.

Additionally, you can track all types of errors based on Plugins, Themes, and WP Core or custom code and resolve exceptions to get optimized performance results.

Monitoring PHP errors is something you need to do if you want to keep your WordPress website secure, healthy, and fast. If not fixed, PHP errors can indeed reduce your website performance and increase your website's vulnerability to downtime and hackers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Where can I find Error Log Files using FTP? =

In Case when WP Admin is blocked due to Error then you may use FTP to check Log files located at /wp-content/uploads/error-log-viewer-wp/ directory.

= Where can I ask for help? =

You may contact our [Support](Report bugs and suggest ideas at: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/error-log-viewer-wp/) at any time.

= Is this plugin GDPR compliant? =

This plugin does not log nor transmit any user data. In fact, it doesn't even do anything on the user-facing part of your website, only in the admin area. This means it should be compliant but I'm not a lawyer.
